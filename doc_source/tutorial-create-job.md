## Prerequisites<a name="tutorial-create-job-prereq"></a>

This tutorial has the following prerequisites:
+ You have an AWS account\.
+ You have access to AWS Glue Studio\.
+ Your account has all the necessary permissions for creating and running a job for an Amazon S3 data source and data target\. 
+ You have created an AWS Identity and Access Management role for the job to use\. You can also choose an IAM role for the job that includes permissions for all your data sources, data targets, temporary directory, scripts, and any libraries used by the job\.
+ The following components exist in AWS:
  + The `Flights Data Crawler` crawler
  + The `flights-db` database
  + The `flightscsv` table
  + The IAM role `AWSGlueServiceRole-CrawlerTutorial`

  To create these components, you can complete the service tutorial **Add a crawler**, which populates the AWS Glue Data Catalog with the necessary objects\. This tutorial also creates an IAM role with the necessary permissions\. You can find the tutorial on the AWS Glue service page at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/glue/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/glue/)\. The tutorial is located in the left\-side navigation, under **Tutorials**\. Alternatively, you can use the documentation version of this tutorial, [Tutorial: Adding an AWS Glue crawler](tutorial-add-crawler.md)\.

## Step 1: Start the job creation process<a name="tutorial-create-job-step1"></a>

In this task, you choose to start the job creation by using a template\. 

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS Glue Studio console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/gluestudio/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/gluestudio/)\.

1. On the AWS Glue Studio landing page, choose **Create and manage jobs**\.

1. On the **Manage jobs** page, under the heading **Create job**, choose the **Source and target added to the graph** option\. Then, choose **S3** for the **Source** and **S3** for the **Target**\.

1. Choose the **Create** button to start the job creation process\.

The job editing page opens with a simple three\-node graph displayed\.

## Step 2: Edit the data source node in the job graph<a name="tutorial-create-job-step2"></a>

Choose the **Data source \- S3 bucket** node in the graph to edit the data source properties\.

1. On the **Node properties** tab in the node details pane, for **Name**, enter a name that is unique for this job\. 

   The value you enter is used as the label for the data source node in the graph\. If you use unique names for the nodes in your job, then it's easier to identify each node in the graph and to select parent nodes\. For this tutorial, enter the name **S3 Flight Data**\.

1. Choose the **Data source properties \- S3** tab in the node details panel\.

1. For **Database**, choose the **flights\-db** database from the list of available databases in your AWS Glue Data Catalog\.

1. For **Table**, enter **flight** in the search field, and then choose the **flightscsv** table from your AWS Glue Data Catalog\.

1. Choose the **Output schema** tab in the node details panel to view the data schema\.

## Step 3: Edit the transform node of the job<a name="tutorial-create-job-step3"></a>

The transform node is where you specify how you want to modify the data from its original format\. An *ApplyMapping* transform enables you to rename data property keys, change the data types, and drop columns from the dataset\.

When you edit the **Transform \- ApplyMapping** node, the original schema for your data is shown in the **Source key** column in the node details panel\. This is the data property key name that is obtained from the source data and stored in the table in the AWS Glue Data Catalog\.

The **Target key** column shows the key name that will appear in the data target\. You can use this field to change the data property key name in the output\. The **Data type** column shows the data type of the key and allows you to change it to different data type for the target\. The **Drop** column contains a check box\. This box allows you to choose a field to drop it from the target schema\.

1. Choose the **Transform \- ApplyMapping** node in the graph to edit the data transformation properties\.

1. In the node details panel, on the **Node properties** tab, review the information\. 

   You can change the name of this node if you want\.

1. Choose the **Transform** tab in the node details panel\.

1. Choose to drop the keys `quarter` and `day_of_week` by selecting the check box in the **Drop** column for each key\. 

1. For the key that shows `day_of_month` in the **Source key** column, change the **Target key** value to `day`\. 

   Change the data type for the `month` and `day` keys to **tinyint**\. The `tinyint` data type stores integers using 1 byte of storage, with a range of values from 0 to 255\. When changing the data type, you must verify that the data type is supported by your target\.

## Step 4: Edit the data target node of the job<a name="tutorial-create-job-step4"></a>

A data target node determines where the transformed output is sent\. The location can be either an Amazon S3 bucket or a Data Catalog table\. If you choose a Data Catalog table, the data is written to the location associated with that table\. For example, if you use a crawler to create a table in the Data Catalog for a JDBC target, the data is written to that JDBC table\.

1. Choose the **Data target \- S3 bucket** node in the graph to edit the data target properties\.

1. In the node details panel on the right, choose the **Node properties** tab\. For **Name**, enter a unique name for the node, such as **Revised Flight Data**\.

1. Choose the **Data target properties \- S3** tab\. 

1. For **Format**, choose **JSON**\. 

   For **Compression type**, keep the default value of **None**\.

   For the **S3 target location**, choose the **Browse S3** button to see the Amazon S3 buckets that you have access to, and choose one as the target destination\.

   For more information about the available options, see [Configuring data target nodesOverview of data target options](edit-nodes-chapter.md#edit-jobs-target-overview)\.

## Step 5: View the job script<a name="tutorial-create-job-view-script"></a>

After you configure all the nodes in the graph, AWS Glue Studio generates a script that is used by the job to read, transform, and write the data in the target location\. 

To view the script, choose the **Script** tab at the top of the graph editing pane\.

## Step 6: Specify the job details and save the job<a name="tutorial-create-job-details"></a>

Before you can save and run your extract, transform, and load \(ETL\) job, you must first enter additional information about the job itself\.

1. Choose the **Job details** tab\. 

1. Enter a name for the jobâ€“for example **FlightDataETL**\. Provide a UTF\-8 string with a maximum length of 255 characters\. 

   You can optionally enter a description of the job\.

1. For the **IAM role**, choose `AWSGlueServiceRole-CrawlerTutorial` from the list of available roles\. 

   If you have many roles to choose from, you can start entering part of the role name in the **IAM role** search field, and the roles with the matching text string will be displayed\. For example, you can enter **tutorial** in the search field to find all roles with `tutorial` \(case\-insensitive\) in the name\. 

   The AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) role is used to authorize access to resources that are used to run the job\. You can only choose roles that already exist in your account\. The role you choose must have permission to access your Amazon S3 sources, targets, temporary directory, scripts, and any libraries used by the job, as well as access to AWS Glue service resources\.

   For the steps to create a role, see [Create an IAM Role for AWS Glue](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/create-an-iam-role.html)\.

1. For the remaining fields, use the default values\.

1. Choose **Save** in the top\-right corner of the page\.

   You should see a notification at the top of the page that the job was successfully saved\.

If you don't see a notification that your job was successfully saved, then there is most likely information missing that prevents the job from being saved\.
+ Review the visual job graph, and choose any node that doesn't have a green check mark\. 
+ If any of the tabs above the graph pane have a callout, choose that tab and look for any fields that are highlighted in red\.

## Step 8: Run the job<a name="tutorial-create-job-step8"></a>

Now that the job has been saved, you can run the job\. Choose the **Run** button at the top of the page\. You should then see a notification that the job was successfully started\. 

You can choose either the link in the notification for **Run Details**, or choose the **Run Details** tab to view the run status of the job\. 

On the **Run Details** tab, there is a card for each recent run of the job with information about that job run\.

For more information about the job run information, see [View information for recent job runs](managing-jobs-chapter.md#view-job-run-details)\.

## Next steps<a name="tutorial-next-steps"></a>

After you start the job run, you might want to try some of the following tasks: 
+ View the job monitoring dashboard â€“ [Accessing the job monitoring dashboard](monitoring-chapter.md#monitoring-accessing-dashboard)\.
+ Try a different transform on the data â€“ [Overview of mappings and transforms](edit-nodes-chapter.md#transforms_overview)\.
+ View the jobs that exist in your account â€“ [View your jobs](managing-jobs-chapter.md#view-jobs)\.

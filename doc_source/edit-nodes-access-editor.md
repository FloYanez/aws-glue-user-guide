# Accessing the job graph editor<a name="edit-nodes-access-editor"></a>

Use the AWS Glue Studio visual graph editor to edit your ETL jobs\.

You can access the visual graph editor in the following ways:
+ Choose **Jobs** in the console navigation pane\. On the **Manage jobs** page, locate the job in the **Your jobs** list\. You can then either: 
  + Choose the name of the job in the **Name** column to open the visual graph editor for that job\.
  + Choose the job, and then choose **Edit job** from the **Actions** list\.
+ Choose **Monitoring** in the console navigation pane\. On the **Monitor job runs** page, locate the job in the **Job runs breakdown** list\. Choose the job you want to edit, and then choose **View run details**\. This opens the **Run details** tab in the visual graph editor\. You can then choose the **Visual** tab to open the visual graph editor\.

You can only edit jobs in the visual graph editor if the jobs were created with AWS Glue Studio\. If the job was created using the AWS Glue console, through API commands, or with the command line interface \(CLI\), then you must use the AWS Glue console, API, or CLI to edit the job\.

# Tutorial: Adding an AWS Glue crawler<a name="tutorial-add-crawler"></a>

For this AWS Glue scenario, you're asked to analyze arrival data for major air carriers to calculate the popularity of departure airports month over month\. You have flights data for the year 2016 in CSV format stored in Amazon S3\. Before you transform and analyze your data, you catalog its metadata in the AWS Glue Data Catalog\.

In this tutorial, letâ€™s add a crawler that infers metadata from these flight logs in Amazon S3 and creates a table in your Data Catalog\.

## Prerequisites<a name="tutorial-add-crawler-prerequisites"></a>

This tutorial assumes that you have an AWS account and access to AWS Glue\.

## Step 1: Add a crawler<a name="tutorial-add-crawler-step1"></a>

Use these steps to configure and run a crawler that extracts the metadata from a CSV file stored in Amazon S3\.

1. On the AWS Glue service console, on the left\-side menu, choose **Crawlers**\.

1. On the Crawlers page, choose **Add crawler**\. This starts a series of pages that prompt you for the crawler details\.

1. In the Crawler name field, enter **Flights Data Crawler**, and choose **Next**\.

   Crawlers invoke classifiers to infer the schema of your data\. This tutorial uses the built\-in classifier for CSV by default\. 

1. For the crawler source type, choose **Data stores** and choose **Next**\.

1. Now let's point the crawler to your data\. On the **Add a data store** page, choose the Amazon S3 data store\. This tutorial doesn't use a connection, so leave the Connection field blank if it's visible\. 

   For the option **Crawl data in**, choose **Specified path in another account**\. Then, for the Include path, enter the path where the crawler can find the flights data, which is **s3://crawler\-public\-us\-east\-1/flight/2016/csv**\. After you enter the path, the title of this field changes to **Include path\.** Choose **Next**\.

1. You can crawl multiple data stores with a single crawler\. However, in this tutorial, we're using only a single data store, so choose **No**, and then choose **Next**\.

1. The crawler needs permissions to access the data store and create objects in the AWS Glue Data Catalog\. To configure these permissions, choose **Create an IAM role**\. The IAM role name starts with `AWSGlueServiceRole-`, and in the field, you enter the last part of the role name\. Enter **CrawlerTutorial**, and then choose **Next**\. 
**Note**  
To create an IAM role, your AWS user must have `CreateRole`, `CreatePolicy`, and `AttachRolePolicy` permissions\.

   The wizard creates an IAM role named `AWSGlueServiceRole-CrawlerTutorial`, attaches the AWS managed policy `AWSGlueServiceRole` to this role, and adds an inline policy that allows read access to the Amazon S3 location `s3://crawler-public-us-east-1/flight/2016/csv`\.

1. Create a schedule for the crawler\. For **Frequency**, choose **Run on demand**, and then choose **Next**\. 

1. Crawlers create tables in your Data Catalog\. Tables are contained in a database in the Data Catalog\. First, choose **Add database** to create a database\. In the pop\-up window, enter **test\-flights\-db** for the database name, and then choose **Create**\.

   Next, enter **flights** for **Prefix added to tables**\. Use the default values for the rest of the options, and choose **Next**\.

1. Verify the choices you made in the **Add crawler** wizard\. If you see any mistakes, you can choose **Back** to return to previous pages and make changes\.

   After you have reviewed the information, choose **Finish** to create the crawler\.

## Step 2: Run the crawler<a name="tutorial-add-crawler-step2"></a>

After creating a crawler, the wizard sends you to the Crawlers view page\. Because you create the crawler with an on\-demand schedule, you're given the option to run the crawler\.

1. The banner near the top of this page lets you know that the crawler was created, and asks if you want to run it now\. Choose **Run it now?** to run the crawler\.

   The banner changes to show "Attempting to run" and Running" messages for your crawler\. After the crawler starts running, the banner disappears, and the crawler display is updated to show a status of Starting for your crawler\. After a minute, you can click the Refresh icon to update the status of the crawler that is displayed in the table\.

1. When the crawler completes, a new banner appears that describes the changes made by the crawler\. You can choose the **test\-flights\-db** link to view the Data Catalog objects\.

## Step 3: View AWS Glue Data Catalog objects<a name="tutorial-add-crawler-step3"></a>

The crawler reads data at the source location and creates tables in the Data Catalog\. A table is the metadata definition that represents your data, including its schema\. The tables in the Data Catalog do not contain data\. Instead, you use these tables as a source or target in a job definition\.

1. In the left\-side navigation, under **Data catalog**, choose **Databases**\. Here you can view the `flights-db` database that is created by the crawler\.

1. In the left\-side navigation, under **Data catalog** and below **Databases**, choose **Tables**\. Here you can view the `flightscsv` table created by the crawler\. If you choose the table name, then you can view the table settings, parameters, and properties\. Scrolling down in this view, you can view the schema, which is information about the columns and data types of the table\.

1. If you choose **View partitions** on the table view page, you can see the partitions created for the data\. The first column is the partition key\.
